Please choose the GitHub option and follow the instructions to authorize Posit Connect to your GitHub account.\nYou should now be logged in to Posit Connect. Please create an API key for your account by following the Posit Connect User Guide instructions on creating an API key.

If you already have a Posit Cloud account, you are welcome to use it for the workshop. Otherwise, you can create a new account for free.\nYou will see a project called shiny-r-prod. Open that project and create a saved copy. This process could take a couple of minutes depending on server load.\nAfter the project loads, you will see messages in the R console about restoring or repairing the package library. Execute renv::restore(prompt = FALSE) to install packages into the project. This process should complete in one or two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal R & RStudio IDE\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer to use a local installation of R and RStudio, ensure you setup meets the following requirements:\n\nR version 4.3 or later.\nLatest release of RStudio IDE, 2023.06.1-524 or later\nThe {renv} R package.\n\nYou can workshop materials using the following procedure:\n\nVisit the workshop repository at https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/shiny-r-prod and either clone to your local machine with Git or download a zip archive of the materials. A direct link to the archive is here.\nLaunch RStudio and open the project file shiny-r-prod.Rproj to initialize the workshop project.\nThe {renv} package will begin bootstrapping the package library. When prompted, run renv::restore() to complete the package installation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker Container with Visual Studio Code & RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\nThe repository for this workshop also gives you the ability to create custom Docker containers to encapsulate a complete R development environment tailored to this workshop. This workshop repository uses a similar container definition as found at https://github.com/rpodcast/r_dev_projects. At a high level, you will need an installation of Visual Studio Code with the Remote Development extension.\n\nVisit the workshop repository at https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/shiny-r-prod and either clone to your local machine with Git or download a zip archive of the materials. A direct link to the archive is here.\nWithin the .devcontainer subdirectory, create a new file called .env based on the template provided at .env.example. In this file, change the value of the environment variable RENV_PATHS_CACHE_HOST to the deisred directory on your system.\nLaunch Visual Studio Code and open the folder of your local copy of the workshop repository.\nYou will be prompted to re-open the folder to begin the container build process. Note that this process can take a few minutes depending on your computer’s hardware specifications and network bandwidth.\nOnce the development container is built, you are free to continue using Visual Studio Code or use a container version of the RStudio open source server by visiting localhost:4567 in your web browser.\n\n\nIf using visual studio code, the user needs to add the renv library path to their r.libPaths setting in the R extension. Details at https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/Working-with-renv-enabled-projects ."
