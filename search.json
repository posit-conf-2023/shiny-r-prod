Posit has generously provided us access to a dedicated workshop coding environment using Posit Cloud, which is accessible with a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, or others. In addition, Posit is also providing a dedicated instance of the Posit Connect platform for hosting Shiny applications that you create and view throughout the workshop.\nIn the first session of the workshop, we will allocate time for everyone to configure their accounts and development environments. If you would like to complete these steps before the workshop, you can follow the procedures detailed in Environment Configuration below."

If you already have an account, you are welcome to use it for the workshop. While version control itself is not a major focus of the course, we will discuss how certain elements can play an important role in application development and deployment. A great resource for getting a basic familiarity with Git version control is Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and GitHub for the useR online book.\nPosit Cloud account: Visit posit.cloud and click the Sign Up link. Then create a Free account. If you already have an account, you do not need to create a new one."

Please choose the GitHub option and follow the instructions to authorize Posit Connect to your GitHub account.\nYou should now be logged in to Posit Connect. Please create an API key for your account by following the Posit Connect User Guide instructions on creating an API key. Save it to a secure place as you will need it for account integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit Cloud\n\n\n\n\n\nView screenshots in full screen\n\n\nJoin the Posit Cloud Workspace dedicated to this workshop by visiting this customized invitation URL. If you already have a Posit Cloud account, you are welcome to use it for the workshop. Otherwise, you can create a new account for free.\nYou will see a project called shiny-r-prod. Open that project and create a saved copy. This process could take a couple of minutes depending on server load.\nAfter the project loads, you will see messages in the R console about restoring or repairing the package library. Execute renv::restore(prompt = FALSE) to install packages into the project. This process should complete in one or two minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal R & RStudio IDE\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer to use a local installation of R and RStudio, ensure you setup meets the following requirements:\n\nR version 4.3 or later.\nLatest release of RStudio IDE, 2023.06.1-524 or later\nThe {renv} R package.\n\nYou can workshop materials using the following procedure:\n\nVisit the workshop repository at https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/shiny-r-prod and either clone to your local machine with Git or download a zip archive of the materials. A direct link to the archive is here.\nLaunch RStudio and open the project file shiny-r-prod.Rproj to initialize the workshop project.\nThe {renv} package will begin bootstrapping the package library. When prompted, run renv::restore() to complete the package installation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker Container with Visual Studio Code & RStudio\n\n\n\n\n\nThe repository for this workshop also gives you the ability to create custom Docker containers to encapsulate a complete R development environment tailored to this workshop.\n\nIf using visual studio code, the user needs to add the renv library path to their r.libPaths setting in the R extension. Details at https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R/wiki/Working-with-renv-enabled-projects ."
